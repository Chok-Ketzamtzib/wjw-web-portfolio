## Project Overview

Developed a complete IoT monitoring system for environmental data collection using embedded C++ programming. The system monitors temperature, humidity, air quality, and other environmental parameters in real-time.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Main processing unit with Wi-Fi capability
- **Sensor Array**: Temperature/humidity, air quality, light sensors
- **Power Management**: Battery backup with solar charging capability
- **Display Interface**: OLED display for local data visualization

### Software Stack
- **Real-time OS**: FreeRTOS for task scheduling and resource management
- **Communication**: MQTT protocol for cloud connectivity
- **Data Processing**: Signal filtering and calibration algorithms
- **Web Interface**: Real-time dashboard for remote monitoring

## Key Achievements

### Performance Optimization
- Optimized power consumption achieving 6+ months battery life
- Implemented efficient data compression reducing bandwidth by 70%
- Real-time processing with <1ms response time for critical alerts

### Reliability Features
- Watchdog timer implementation for system recovery
- Redundant sensor readings with outlier detection
- Over-the-air (OTA) update capability for remote maintenance

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Memory Constraints**: Optimized memory usage in 512KB RAM environment
2. **Power Management**: Implemented deep sleep modes with wake-on-interrupt
3. **Wireless Reliability**: Robust connection handling with automatic reconnection
4. **Data Integrity**: Checksums and error correction for sensor data

## Results

Successfully deployed 50+ units in field testing with 99.7% uptime over 6 months. The system provided early warning for environmental hazards and helped optimize HVAC systems, resulting in 15% energy savings.
